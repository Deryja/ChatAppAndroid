# ChattingAppAndroid

This is a fully functioning Android chat app made with the Java programming language, and Firebase as database. When a user sign ups, his name, email, password and
userid will be saved in the Authentication and realtime database in Firebase. All the signed up users will have their information displayed in the realtime database. 
After signing up and logging in, the user will be able to chat with other users who have also signed up.
The IDE used in this project is Android Studio. 
Don't forget to set the Firebase Real time database rules to "true"
